          <p> Hello, my name is Thomas! I currently work as a registered nurse in Toronto,
          in acute medicine and surgery units across two different hospitals. I hope
          to become a critical care nurse in both the ER and ICU. I also aspire
          to become a Physician Assistant, currently applying to UofT PA program (Sept 2020)!
          I am learning web-development as a hobby. Join me on my journey!</p>
